# Hello!

I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at the University of California, San Diego. I am also the Program Director for the Early Research Scholars Program ([ERSP](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/ersp/home)) at UCSD. 

My work lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and computing education. I study how students learn AI and machine learning concepts, what makes these ideas challenging, and how evidence-based teaching practices can support learning and strengthen student self-efficacy. I also examine how early undergraduate research experiences encourage engagement, nurture research skills, and broaden participation in computing. In parallel, I work on developing agents capable of detecting and adapting to novel situations in dynamic multi-agent environments using reinforcement learning and machine learning. Broadly, my research interests include AI education, early undergraduate research experiences, machine learning, and reinforcement learning.

I am here to support students, whether you’re tackling complex concepts or need to chat about your computer science journey.

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) and my Master’s in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/). Before diving back into academia, I spent five years in the software industry.
