# Hello!

I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at the University of California, San Diego. I am also the Program Director for the Early Research Scholars Program ([ERSP](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/ersp/home)) at UCSD. 

My work focuses on advancing AI education, with research interests in computing education, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and causal inference. I am passionate about evidence-based approaches that enhance student learning of complex AI concepts. I am here to support students, whether you’re tackling complex concepts or need to chat about your computer science journey.

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) and my Master’s in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/). Before diving back into academia, I spent five years in the software industry.

Fun fact: I am a certified scuba diver.
